# How it Works:
1. Our system monitors user flow and assess the relationship between all pages on an aggregated basis.
2. We then dynamically create a baseline navigation graph across the entire site. 
3. AI then builds a probability model of where users will click next based on multiple user variables.  
4. Machine learning constantly improves its predictions and recalculates it ever 15 mins with a look back window over the last 30 days.
5. We create prefetching instruction for each page of the site for files which are likely to be needed next.  We load these pages in the background.  The user is unaware this is happening.
6. We then preload users next page so when they click the link they are delivered an instant page.
7. Hey presto! Your users receive a better user experience and you achieve more sales!

# More about Mobile Shoppers
M-Commerce has seen massive growth over the last number of years with the advancement of mobile phones.  Network connections vary as people try to shop online on the move.  This can cause pages to be slow to load and increase cart abandonment rates.  

Our software predicts and preloads the users next page so it delivers instant page speeds.  If you see lots of users shopping from mobile device our software could benefit your site particularly well.

# Settings
Shop owners can choose the free or paid versions.  The free version preloads less links than the paid version and delivers 25% speed benefit.
